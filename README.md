# QuickSpace #

An Android tool for showing you a quick overview of your storage partitions and their current levels

### Functionality ###

* Simple used/free space information
* PieChart to quickly see where you may need to free up space


### Note ###

This codebase is no longer being maintained. I have migrated it over to Bitbucket.

This version of the app was developed with Eclipse/Ant and  I've since moved over to using AndroidStudio/Gradle and uploading to Bitbucket. I can't guarantee this repo will be here forever.

Head over there for the most recent code:
